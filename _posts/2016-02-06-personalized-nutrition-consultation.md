# Personalized Nutrition Consultation 

Nutritional Consultation starts with addressing your needs, priorities, concerns and continues with follow ups to ensure that the plan is working for you. It is important to recognize that everyone is different and personalized approach is vital to achive best results for you. You will get full attention, support and tools which empower you to take more confident steps in your healthier lifestyle journey.

Before the first consultation, you will be provided with a Intake Form and Three Day Food Journal for completion. Initial consultation lasts around 60 to 90 minutes. In this time we will discuss your current health concerns, symptoms, eating habits, medical and family history, lifestyle, use of medication, supplements and diet. This information is used to evaluate your individual needs and develop a personalised, safe and effective nutrition and lifestyle programme for you. I will increase your knowledge about food and your relationship with food.

Follow up consultations

are usually around four weeks after the initial consultation in order to observe progress and make any necessary modifications. However, this timing can vary, depending on your circumstances and requirements. While some patients only require two or three consultations, you have the ability to shape your follow-up schedule based on your individual needs and priorities.

My expertise is in digestive health, mood & mental health, food intolerances & sensitivities, immune system concerns, food as medicine. 

What to expect:

The initial appointment is one hour and following appointments are 30 minutes.

The nutrition coach will help you complete a personalized road map to healthy living by empowering you to make lifestyle changes that interest YOU.

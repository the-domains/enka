My focus is on nutritional psychology, with 

### [specialization in digestive health][0]with preventive and maintenance approach. I have have been researching different diets, nutrition methods, mind-body techniques, psychology, integrative medicine for the last 10 years, experimenting and analyzing different alternative approaches which also helped me with my own health struggles. I will share my knowledge with you from all these years of studying and searching.
